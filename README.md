## Abstract

Many biological and physical datasets can be modeled as Gaussian processes, whose parameters can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. The likelihood can be expressed as a product of conditional probabilities, where each term provides information about the model's behavior and dynamics. Here, we present a versatile framework for retrieving the physical properties of these models using products of univariate Gaussians that depend on a set of observed and hidden variables. To do so, our model uses a recurrence formula to integrate over the hidden variables, enabling fast and accurate computing.
This framework is particularly effective for characterizing recurrent Gaussian processes. In the last section, we show the use of our framework via three microscopy applications: determining the type of motion of a particle, modeling time-dependent changes in FRET efficiency, and detecting confinement between two particles.
